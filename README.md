# sublime-packages

- Requires Package Control to be installed
- Clone contents into the Packages/User Folder
- `composer global require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`, the fix shortcut is ctrl+alt+f
- Task kill Sublime Text
- When Sublime Text is restarted, the packages will be installed
- If PHP Companion find_use does not work, deleting Packages/User/.git might help
